Note: With the WFS, you can get the attribute information associated with the disaster:-)","Email from Todd on 22 Oct 2009 - Thanks for your note, I think we have just the thing to help you. As part of its Global Hazards Information Network (GHIN, http://ghin.pdc.org), Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) publishes various mapservices for public consumption, one of them being active hazards. GHIN is a metadata explorer containing geospatial data and services, of both PDC's data holdings and those and its partners. It has been designed to facilitate data sharing relationships/partnerships around the globe (focused towards hazards and related basedata). I've recently met with your colleagues in Bangkok and happy to report that UN OCHA ROAP is now a GHIN partner. In the coming months we will be working with OCHA ROAP to catalog and ingest metadata on their data holdings into GHIN so that it can be found by GHIN users. I should add that GHIN partners retain full control over the release of their data, which is specified in the metadata.  To find services in GHIN, choose 'Live Data and Maps' as your Content Type and click 'Start Search'. You will be presented with a list of all the services that we are currently publishing. Services are available as ArcIMS Image, WMS, and WFS. The metadata record for each service has connection information, as does the Geospatial Information Services link on GHIN.  The service you are looking for is called 'PDC Active Hazards'. You can simply add a connection to http://www.pdc.org in the GIS Servers section of ArcCatalog. Then select the service and drag into ArcMap. The Active Hazards service has near-real time feeds for tropical storms, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunami's, and more. Please see the metadata for that service for data sources and data refresh rates."

Use MODIS Rapid Response Subset data to identify water pixels on RGB (bands 7-2-1) geotiff files (http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/subsets/).  A GIS vector is then fit around the classified pixels.  The data are organized by MODIS Rapid Response Subset name, by date, and by Terra (""t"") or Aqua (""a"") source.
Is is 250 m, with the inundation limits (what boundaries) fixed geographically to better than +/50 m.  Images appear on the rapid response nasa site in near real time..at most some hours after acquisition. Our processing only takes perhaps an hour. For each area on Earth there are two passes..am and pm.

How fast maps and GIS data appear afterwards depends on our focus. If there is active flooding underway..and we know there is immediate need, then we can ourselves process and update daily...and those data may be less than 24 hours old in some cases.
Currently publishing GIS files with date  names...but that, over the course of  a year for a particular subset, we intend to then merge all files into an annual maximum water layer and publish that accumulating file...as well as a variety of standard reference water files to compare the new water to. These will be at same location..I am working on a read me file to go there as well,"

Scroll down to ""IRI"", and click on it. 
Click on Forecast Division.  Click on Seasonal Forecast.  Click on precipitation (if that is what you want).  Click on tercile probability. 
Click where it says Data Selection (toward the upper right side of page). 
    In the panel where it says ""Setting Ranges"", change the text to what  you want. If you want the Jan-Feb-Mar forecast for Dec 2009, then you put the following:

Then click on ""stop selecting"", at the bottom of the panel just above the panel you have just been working. 
You should be taken back to the page you saw previously. Now you are ready to download the data file. Click on ""Data Files"" in the upper right. 
Now you get a large range of options of data format for the data to be downloaded. 
Goto: GIS-Compatible Formats - 2-Dimensional Table
Download Below_Normal and Above_Normal files.
Add .txt extension to files in Windows Explorer. 
Go to ArcTools. Coversion Tools - To Raster - ASCII to Raster.  Input txt file as the Input raster and generate the raster
Goto ArcToolbox - Data Management Tools - Projections and Transformations - Define Projection - I recommend WGS84 Lat/Lon
Both files should be in your ArcGIS.  Open Spatial Analyst tool bar.  
Goto Reclassify.  Change the values for Above Normal and change all values to negative. (So if its 10 change it to -10)
